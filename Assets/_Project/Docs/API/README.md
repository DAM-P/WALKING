# DOTS Project API Documentation

## Scope

This documentation describes the runtime APIs (MonoBehaviours, ScriptableObjects, DOTS components, Bakers, and Systems) in `Assets/_Project/Scripts`.

- Audience: developers extending gameplay, systems, and tools
- Version: WIP (incremental) â€” we will expand module-by-module

## Conventions

- Names of files, classes, systems are shown using backticks (e.g., `StageManager`, `ExtendExecutionSystem`)
- DOTS components implement `IComponentData`
- DOTS systems are either `ISystem` (struct) or `SystemBase` (class)
- Authoring uses the Baker pattern (`Baker<TAuthoring>`)
